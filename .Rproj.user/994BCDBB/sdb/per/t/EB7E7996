In fact, there are eight different common blood types, which are determined by the presence or absence of certain antigens – substances that can trigger an immune response if they are foreign to the body. Since some antigens can trigger a patient's immune system to attack the transfused blood, safe blood transfusions depend on careful blood typing and cross-matching.\n\n\n<<chunk1, echo=FALSE>>=\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nblood.type <- c(\"O+\",\"A+\",\"B+\",\"AB+\",\"O-\",\"A-\",\"B-\",\"AB-\")\nperccent<- c(37.4,35.7,8.5,3.4,6.6,6.3,1.5,0.6)\n\ndf = data.frame(blood.type,perccent)\n\n g<-ggplot(df,aes(x=blood.type, y=perccent,fill=blood.type))+geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\ng+scale_fill_grey()\n@\n\nAs the chart above shows, O positive is the most common blood type in the United States. Not all ethnic groups have the same mix of these blood types. Hispanic people, for example, have a relatively high number of O’s, while Asian people have a relatively high number of B’s.\n\n<<chunk2, eval = F>>=\n3+7\n@\n\n\n\\end{document}",
